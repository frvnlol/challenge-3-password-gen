# Week 3 Challenge: JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

This is a random password generator created using Javascript. 

Upon vising the website, you will be prompted to choose your password criteria. That being whether you want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and/ or numbers. After choosing your desired prompts, the website will generate you a completely random password that includes the prompts that you chose.

Through this project I bettered my knowledge when it comes to the entirety of JavaScript. For example: 
1: The importance of utilizing global and local scopes.
2: For loops and if else statements.
3: Creating functions that work seamlessly.

This project gave me good practice that I know will be more than useful when it comes to creating future projects.
